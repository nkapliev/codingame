In this repo I want to share my experience in solving artificial intelligence bot challenges from [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) platform.  

The main idea of CodinGame competitions is not just to write fastest code as fast as you can, but to literally beat by this code your opponent's bots. It's more like programmers gladiator fights. But cooler :computer::rage2::crown:
